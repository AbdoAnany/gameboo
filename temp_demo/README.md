# Temp Demo Folder

This folder is for temporary demo files and experiments.

## Purpose

- Store temporary glass widget demos
- Test new UI components
- Experiment with designs before integrating into main app
- Avoid confusion with main project files

## Usage

- Create demo files here when testing new features
- Use clear naming conventions like: `glass_demo_v1.dart`, `navigation_test.dart`, etc.
- Clean up old demo files regularly

## Note

This folder keeps demo work separate from the main GameX project to avoid confusion.
